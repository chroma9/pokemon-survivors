/**
 * Smeargle's signature, Sketch (the Kecleon Egg's one-stage family): its tail
 * paints a move off the foe nearest to it, a boss in reach first, and casts
 * that move for `SKETCH.casts` casts before it paints again. The move follows
 * the foe's first type (`SKETCH_COPY`); a boss lends its stronger one
 * (`SKETCH_BOSS`); with no foe in reach it paints from memory, a seeded pick.
 * The painted move hits at Sketch's level (or that move's max), scaled by its
 * damage like Metronome, and its hitboxes count as Sketch's. Spread at the end
 * of `MOVES`; drawn by `render/eggMoveFx.ts` (the brush and the bubble).
 *
 * This module only reads `moves.ts` at cast time (it is evaluated first).
